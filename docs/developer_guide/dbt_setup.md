The following sections are covered in this document:

### Repo Clone
First you need to clone this repo locally using Visual studio code. For these instructions the feature/dev or dev branch will be the branches to work with.

If you do not get the Clone Repository option when selecting Source Control from the menu, then you have not installed GIT and will need to complete that first.
