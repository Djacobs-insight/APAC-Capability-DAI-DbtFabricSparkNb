# Dbt Fabric Spark Notebook Generator (Dbt-FabricSparkNb)

> A first and only dbt adapter for a true, modern, software-as-a-service (SAAS) Lakehouse.

## What is it

...

## Why did we build it?


## How does it work?
Dbt-FabricSparkNb works by leverging the power of the dbt-core, and the [dbt-fabrickspark](https://github.com/microsoft/dbt-fabricspark) apater to create a new adapter. As such, it can be described as a "child apater" of [dbt-fabrickspark](https://github.com/microsoft/dbt-fabricspark). 

The adapter inherits all of the functionality of the [dbt-fabrickspark](https://github.com/microsoft/dbt-fabricspark) adapter and simply extends it to meet the unique requirements of our project.

Consequently, to use this adapter, you will need to install the [dbt-fabrickspark](https://github.com/microsoft/dbt-fabricspark) adapter and then install the [dbt-fabricksparknb](https://github.com/Insight-Services-APAC/APAC-Capability-DAI-DbtFabricSparkNb) adapter.
